## Title
Economic Impact of COVID-19 in the Americas: A Pre- and Post-Pandemic Analysis


## Main Question

How did COVID-19 affect economic indicators like employment rates, GDP, and income levels across the Americas, and what trends have emerged in the post-pandemic recovery?

## Description

This project aims to analyze the economic impact of COVID-19 in North, Central, and South America by comparing key economic indicators before, during, and after the pandemic. Using datasets on employment rates, GDP growth, and income distribution, this project will uncover which sectors were most affected and how economic recovery has varied across regions and income groups. The analysis will help highlight the structural changes in the economy triggered by the pandemic and identify key areas for policy focus in recovery efforts.
